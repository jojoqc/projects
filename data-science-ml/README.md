# ⚙️ Data Science & 🤖 Machine Learning

This repository brings together different **Data Science and Machine Learning** projects, designed to show how to work with data in a complete workflow:  
from collecting and cleaning data, to training models, evaluating them, and deploying them into real production environments.  

On the **Data Science** side, you’ll find projects that cover:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: understanding, cleaning, and transforming data.  
- **Visualization**: using charts and dashboards to clearly communicate insights.  
- **Data Pipelines**: reproducible processes to prepare and organize information.  

On the **Machine Learning** side, the focus is on applying different types of models to solve real-world problems:  
- **Supervised models** (regression and classification).  
- **Unsupervised models** (clustering, dimensionality reduction).  
- **Deep Learning** for computer vision and natural language processing (NLP), etc.  
- **Optimization and validation** to ensure models are reliable and not just good on paper.  

There’s also a space for **MLOps** practices, including controlled experimentation, model versioning, API deployment, and container-based automation, so solutions don’t just stay in notebooks but can actually be used in real projects.  

This repository aims to be a mix of both **practical** and **technical**, showing how to take a data-driven idea from scratch and turn it into something truly usable. 🚀
